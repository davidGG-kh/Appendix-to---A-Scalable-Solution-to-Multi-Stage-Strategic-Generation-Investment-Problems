This repository contains the supplementary material for the paper "A Scalable Solution to Multi-Stage Strategic Generation Investment Problems" to be submitted to the Power Systems Computation Conference (PSCC 2018). This is joint work by Vladimir Dvorkin, Jalal Kazempour, Pierre Pinson from the Department of Electrical Engineering of the Technical University of Denmark and Luis Baringo from the School of Industrial Engineering of Universidad de Castilla La Mancha.

This repository provides the following materials:
1. GAMS code to solve the illustrative example in section IV-A with a direct approach (Direct_example.gms)
2. GAMS code to solve the illustrative example in section IV-A with a progressive hedging algorithm, decomposing the problem by long-term scenario only (PH-LT, PH_LT_example.gms)
3. GAMS code to solve the illustrative example in section IV-A with a proposed progressive hedging algorithm, which simultaneously decomposes the problem by long-term and market scenarios (PH-LT&MS, PH_LT_MS_example.gms)
4. GAMS code to solve the IEEE one-area RTS case study in section IV-B with a proposed progressive hedging algorithm (IEEE_one_area_system.gms) and relevant data files (existing_generators.csv and rival_generators.csv)
